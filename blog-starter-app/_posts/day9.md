Today, I focused on developing the logic to collect data from the feedback form. After reviewing previous IPA projects:

- I couldn't find a solution.
- I decided to start by collecting data with React hooks.
- I revisited old projects, identifying props and hooks, but ended up following a tutorial.

I came across a tutorial on adding a feedback form to Next.js, but encountered some challenges.

I also addressed deployment issues. After committing and pushing my latest updates, I noticed that my GitHub repository wasn't updated. I checked and initiated a pull request, suspecting that the problem might be due to working on a branch, although I hadn't experienced such an issue before. Upon submitting the pull request, I realized that I had been deploying the same repository twice. They had similar names, and initially, I thought one of the deployments wasn't working. However, upon checking in Vercel, I found that one of the projects was empty. Nevertheless, I tackled the issue by deleting one of the projects, resolving the deployment issues.

Deployment seemed ready, but only some changes appeared... ðŸ¤” The .md files weren't updated in the main branch, so I merged, added, committed, and voila! A new post update appeared in the app.
