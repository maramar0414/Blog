I worked on day 2 of the CSS Calendar Advent.I added some styling, where I learned about CSS @layers and @apply rules, which I havenâ€™t heard before. My biggest take away from @layer are control over style order and readability and maintainability.I added properties in the root using Tailwind, and played around with some Tailwind properties in the component.

 #challenges I faced #

Using the wrong terminal and directory.
Tailwind debugging.
