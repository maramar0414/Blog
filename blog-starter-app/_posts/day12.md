Today, I started my challenge by installing Firebase in my project and following the documentation instructions. I created a project in Firebase and proceeded with the installation as suggested in the documentation.
However, I am encountering some errors during the installation.When I searched for the errors, it seems to be related to Node.js and npm. I followed the steps to fix the problem, but I am still experiencing the same issue.
Now, it's time to conduct a more in-depth research.
