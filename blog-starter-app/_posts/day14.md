I'm still stuck on the Firebase installation and deployment issues. I do need to ask for help, and in the meantime, today, I am exploring the idea of including Supabase in my project so that the responses from the feedback form will be stored in a table.

I have used Supabase a couple of times before, and I am enjoying the simplicity of creating and accessing the tables. However, I know that Supabase may not make much sense without authentication, but maybe it is something that I can take advantage of later, as this is only the beginning of my idea.

The first step I take is to read the documentation on how I can include Supabase in a Next.js project. I'm still unsure if it is a good idea, but I need to move on with the project, as I have set a deadline for myself to share this website with the world. I believe deadlines are important to get things done. 

Secondly, I searched for examples of Next.js with Supabase and learned how to use and incorporate them. I downloaded a template and encountered a surprise: a new error!

This error provided me with more information about what might be happening. Tomorrow, I will tackle Firebase again and try to resolve the issue..
