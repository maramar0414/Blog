A few days ago, I explored how to add a new entry to the blog. I am happy with it, and I would like to add new things like a nav-bar, so Iâ€™ve been spending my time studying the components and refreshing the structure of Next.js.

Today, I learned where each component is, adding text to the component. I have added some comments to those which I found harder to find, such as the Header, which is only visible inside of a post.

I also changed the footer style a bit and added some of my content.
