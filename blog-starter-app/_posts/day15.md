Today, I'm working on an Angular Fire project. It's a tutorial for installing and using AngularFire, which I'm using because I've had difficulty implementing it in my project. So, some documentation and a tutorial are necessary.

Everything was going well with the tutorial until one of the commands didn't work. I tried troubleshooting it by referring to the documentation. It seems the problem may lie with npm, so I followed all the steps and tried again. However, I still encountered the same issue (the same thing happened on Thursday).

I've decided to delete the project and start over.

Following the steps, I've gotten stuck in the same place again. There's something wrong with the npm path, but I can't seem to fix it. I've manually changed the path, although it's not recommended on Windows, but it didn't help. I've followed all the documentation and tutorials, yet I still encounter problems when using Firebase as a command.
