I've made the decision to step back from the IPA issues for now. I'm eager to share my blog ASAP, so after a week of struggling, I've concluded it's time to adjust my plan. I'm determined to incorporate a feedback form into my blog, but I realize I can't tackle it alone. Here's the revised plan:

1. Take a breather from the problem.
2. Seek assistance.
3. Develop an interim solution.

Today, I'm focusing on that interim solution. I've added social media icons, including my email address. Here's my agenda for today:

- Search for social media icon images.
- Incorporate the images into the project.
- Integrate them into the footer.
- Style them into three columns with responsiveness.

**Learnings:**
Today, I discovered the benefits of working with isolated components. Additionally, I mastered using Flexbox with Tailwind.

**Challenges I Faced:**
Initially, I struggled to apply styling with Tailwind. I took a step back, implemented the desired styling with CSS, and once satisfied, I sought how to replicate it with Tailwind, referencing a Tailwind cheat sheet along the way.
