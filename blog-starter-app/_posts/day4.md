title: "Day 4: Storybook "
excerpt: "Today, I worked on the Advent Calendar project within the Redwood framework. The task involved adding new components and creating different stories within the same component. This marked my first experience with Storybook, and I found it remarkably user-friendly for working with each component in isolation. I'm exited about learning more Storybook . This so far, it stands out as my favourite aspect of Week 1 in the #100daysofCode challenge. "
