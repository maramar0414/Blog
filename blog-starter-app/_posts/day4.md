title: "Day 4: Storybook "
excerpt: "Over Christmas, I started a Redwood challenge but found it tough amidst life and demo day approaching. Opting for the 100 days of code, I faced hurdles switching from npm to yarn and initializing the project due to incomplete documentation review. The initial challenge of building an SVG icon component prompted a return to documentation and tutorials for better understanding of Redwood's React components. "

Today, I worked on the Advent Calendar project within the Redwood framework. The task involved adding new components and creating different stories within the same component. This marked my first experience with Storybook, and I found it remarkably user-friendly for working with each component in isolation. I'm exited about learning more Storybook . This so far, it stands out as my favourite aspect of Week 1 in the #100daysofCode challenge.
