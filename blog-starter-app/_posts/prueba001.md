##  
During the Christmas period, I started a challenge with Redwood; however, it was hard to keep up with life and demo day around the corner. So, the 100 days of code is the perfect commitment to learn new things and refresh old learnings.

First, I installed the app and its packages during the Christmas period. I found it challenging to switch from npm to yarn; it took me a couple of days to figure out how to do it. After some research, I realized the problem was in the Terminal. PowerShell doesn’t work with yarn, so the solution was as easy as opening a new Gitbash Terminal.

Later, it was hard to understand how to initialize the project. Mistake number one: I jumped into a completely new framework without properly reading the documentation. Yep, I paid the price with my time…

Finally, I started the first challenge: building an SVG icon component. I tried to do it myself following React logic, but I couldn’t understand much about how Redwood uses React components, so I took one step back and looked into the documentation. Still without a clue, I jumped into the tutorial.
