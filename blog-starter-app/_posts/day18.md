Yesterday I reflected on my Journey during the challenge and I came to the conclusion that I need to structure more my days and solid the fundamental to smash it in interviews. 

School of Code, not just teach how to code but help us in the job hunt. We have help with interviews examples, CVâ€™s feedback and resources to get ready for an interview. 

In the last session, we were assign to a new team every 15 mins and we needed to complete one of the challenges. One of the challenges was from Frontend Mentor, we only had time to plan what we would do but I still wanted to tried so I tried a challenge myself.

So today I have worked on a Front-end challenge, where I had to replicate a blog preview card. I was giving some styling guidance as font as colours and the freedom of choosing a language of my preference. 

I decided to work with HTML and CSS, as I feel I need to solid the fundamentals. I approach this challenge as we were taught in School of Code. Plan, plan and then code. I planned a low-fidelity design in Figma first. Once I have a clear vision on what and how I'm going to do it, I wrote some pseudocode in the HTML file, which include the HTML elements and some basic style of each element as size.
