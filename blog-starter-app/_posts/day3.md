Today, I felt tired after applying for a few jobs, but I didn't want to miss a day from the challenge. So, I decided to keep myself away from any project and practice CSS properties. I refreshed my knowledge of Flexbox using a game, where I revisited the properties of:

flex-direction
justify-content
align-items
Additionally, I learned more about align-self and flex-grow.

I won't lie; I had to refer to the cheat sheet a couple of times.
