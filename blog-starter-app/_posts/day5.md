Today, I refreshed my knowledge of Next.js through the School of Code. I duplicated a Next.js template and successfully deployed it using Vercel. Following the deployment, I delved into the code structure, meticulously examining each folder and file to grasp their respective functions. To solidify my understanding for future reference, I added comments throughout the codebase.

 ## Challenges I faced 

- Understanding how a new blog entry was generated, as I had not encountered a .md file format before.
-React props. I had to refresh the concept. 
-deploying the project posed its own set of challenges, particularly with regard to routing.
-Using a GitHub repository, I initially overlooked that the project was within a folder, leading me to misroute it to the parent directory initially.
